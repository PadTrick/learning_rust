#Pong
Pong finshed, but still room for improvements.
- Tweak the constans to change how the game feels to play.
- Make the paddles have a velocity, so the player can have more fine-grained control over their movement.
- Add a score counter, and make the field reset after a ball goes offscreen.
- Add some cool effects, or replace sprites.
- Rewrite the game using an ECS library like Specs, Legion or Hecs.
